<h1>Acceptable User Guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#acceptable-user-guidelines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>OIT CI Research Computing (OIT-CIRC) resources are deployed, configured, and operated to serve a large, diverse user community. It is important that all users are aware of and abide by OIT-CIRC Usage Policies. Failure to do so may result in suspension or cancellation of the project and associated allocation and closure of all associated logins. Illegal transgressions will be addressed through University of Texas at Dallas (UT-D) and/or legal authorities.</p>
<div class="section" id="account-eligibility">
<h2>Account Eligibility<a class="headerlink" href="#account-eligibility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>OIT-CIRC resources are available to faculty and staff at UT-Dallas, OIT-CIRC Research Partners, Texas higher educational institutions, and to US academic researchers. Additional supporting documentation may be required prior to accessing OIT-CIRC resources.</p>
<p>Eligible UT-Dallas, OIT-CIRC Partner, and Texas higher education users can request OIT-CIRC accounts. Individuals and groups that engage in collaborative research and development activities with UT-D are eligible to apply for user accounts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="passwords">
<h2>Passwords<a class="headerlink" href="#passwords" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>OIT-CIRC users must choose a strong password that should be unique to your OIT-CIRC username. Passwords (passphrases) for accounts should follow a model that results in fewer unintended lockouts for users.</p>
<p>Accounts (whether locally created through either computer or application, or through the NetID system) must follow the password (passphrase) requirements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Minumum password length: 12 characters</li>
<li>Enforce maximum password age: 365 days</li>
<li>Previous passwords must not be reused after being changed(Password history: 10 passwords)</li>
<li>It should not contain NetID or your name</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">

<li>uppercase letter</li>
<li>lowercase letter</li>
<li>number</li>
<li>special character</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Number of allowed failed logon attempts: 25</li>
<li>Reset failed login after: 60 minutes</li>
<li>Accounts when locked out remain locked until removed by administrators or by users via self-service</li>

<h3>Disciplinary Actions<a class="headerlink" href="#disciplinary-actions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Punishment for infractions includes but is not limited to the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Written or verbal warnings</li>
<li>Revocation of access privilages to OIT-CIRC systems</li>
<li>Termination of project(s) at OIT-CIRC</li>

<div class="section" id="be-a-good-citizen">
<h3>Be a Good Citizen<a class="headerlink" href="#be-a-good-citizen" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Know when your on a login node.</strong> You can use your Linux prompt, the “hostname” command, or other mechanisms to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Know what’s appropriate on a login node.</strong> A login node is a good place to edit and manage files, initiate file transfers, compile code, submit new jobs, and track existing jobs.</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>Avoid computationally intensive activity on login nodes.</strong> This means</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last">
<li>Dont run research applications on the login nodes; this includes frameworks like MATLAB and R.</li>
<li>Don’t launch too many simultaneous processes: while it’s fine to compile on a login node “make -j 16” (which compiles on 16 cores) may be a bit rude.</li>
<li>That script you wrote to check jobs status should probably do so every few minutes rather than serveral times a second.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="internal-and-external-networks">
<h3>Internal and External Networks<a class="headerlink" href="#internal-and-external-networks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Avoid too many simultaneous file transfers.</strong> You share the network bandwidth with oter users; don’t use more than your fair share. Two or three concurrent sessions is probably fine. Twent is probably not.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid recursive file transfers,</strong> especially those involving many small files. Create a tar archive before transfers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="submitting-jobs">
<h3>Submitting Jobs<a class="headerlink" href="#submitting-jobs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>When you submit a job to the scheduler, <strong>don’t ask for more time than you really need.</strong> The sscheduler wiil have an easier time finding a slot for the 2 hours you need than the 48 hours you request. This means the shorter queue wait times for you and everybody else.</li>
<li><strong>Test your submission scripts.</strong> Start small: make sure everything works on 2 nodes before you try 200. Work out submission bugs and kinks with 5 minute jobs that won’t wait long in the queue and involve short, simple substitutes for your real workload: simple test problems; “hello world” codes; one-liners like “ibrun hostname”; or an ldd on your executable.</li>
<li><strong>Respect memory  limits and other system onstraints.</strong> If your application needs more memory than is available, your hob will fail, and may leave nodes in unusable states. Monitor your application’s needs. Execute “module load remora” followed by “module help remora” for more information on a particularly handy monitoring tool.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="section" id="utilization">
<h2>Utilization<a class="headerlink" href="#utilization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>OIT-CIRC has documented the purpose and proper use of resources and services via a series of
user guides and other web-based documents available on the OIT-CIRC web site. Users assume
the responsibility for becoming familiar with this documentation, particularly relating to issues
such as adherence to resource limits, proper and considerate use of the batch queuing system,
understanding the purpose and proper use of file systems and storage services, and proper use of
OIT-CIRC resources.</p>
<p>Use of OIT-CIRC resources should be used only for work directly related to the project for
which the resources were requested and granted. OIT-CIRC resources should only be used for
documented or obvious intended purpose.</p>
<p>The login or front-end nodes of the OIT-CIRC compute cluster(s) are reserved for compiling,
loading, and preparing to submit jobs to run in a batch queue. Running compute or I/O bound
processes on these nodes will cause excess overhead and affect the ability of the general user
community to use the systems effectively. Processes inappropriate to execute on these nodes will
automatically be killed and the user notified. Users repeatedly violating these guidelines will be
denied access to the system and must contact OIT-CIRC before access is restored.</p>
<p>The OIT-CIRC data storage resources are intended to provide the user community with a high-
speed, shared storage facility that is available to applications that span multiple OIT-CIRC
resources. Data stored on any OIT-CIRC data storage resource must be associated with research
projects approved by OIT-CIRC. Users storing data not meeting this criterion may lose all rights
to use OIT-CIRC resources. All users assume the responsibility for reading the information
contained in the appropriate system User Guide.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="account-deactivation-guidelines">
<h2>Account Deactivation Guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#account-deactivation-guidelines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Accounts will be deactivated for one of the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>PI Request</strong> - An account deactivation request by a PI will result in the account being denied access to use the PI’s project’s allocation if the account does not have access to another active project.</li>
<li><strong>Project Expiration</strong> - Upon project expiration, all accounts (PI and user) will be immediately denied access to the allocation, and OIT-CIRC-issued user certificates will be revoked unless users have access to other active projects. All batch and remote job submissions will subsequently be rejected.</li>
<li><strong>Violation of OIT-CIRC Guidelines</strong> - Any user account determined by OIT-CIRC to be in violation of an OIT-CIRC guideline will immediately be denied access to all OIT-CIRC resources without notification.</li>
<li><strong>Account Inactivity</strong> - User accounts will be deactivated due to inactivity after 120 calendar days. This will be done automatically and users will have to submit a ticket to have their account reactivated. Any successful login to an OIT-CIRC resource (including the OIT-CIRC User Portal) will reset this timer.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-retention">
<h2>Data Retention<a class="headerlink" href="#data-retention" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All data in /home and /work will remain on OIT-CIRC storage resources as long as the researcher is actively using the storage. Each user will be allocated 20GB of storage space on /home and this space will be backed up. Each research group will have 1TB of storage in /work. Storage space on /scratch is open to all users, however abuse of the /scratch resource will lead to disciplinary actions. To make the storage space more available to all campus users, all data stored in the OIT-CIRC /scratch area will be purged on a time-based basis according to the following schedule:</p>
<p>Every 30 days files larger than 5 TB will be purged.</p>
<p>Every 60 days files larger than 1 TB will be purged.</p>
<p>Every 180 days, all files will be purged.</p>
<p>If a group or PI requests more permanent storage, please send a message to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:ganymedeadmins&#37;&#52;&#48;utdallas&#46;edu">ganymedeadmins<span>&#64;</span>utdallas<span>&#46;</span>edu</a> to schedule an appointment to discuss purchasing more storage on OIT-CIRC high performance storage devices. User attempts to circumvent the file ages will face disciplinary actions</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="user-support">
<h2>User Support<a class="headerlink" href="#user-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>OIT-CIRC users are encouraged to request assitance from OIT-CIRC support when necessary. All requests for support must be submitted through email the OIT-CIRC email address <a class="reference external" href="mailto:ganymedeadmins&#37;&#52;&#48;utdallas&#46;edu">ganymedeadmins<span>&#64;</span>utdallas<span>&#46;</span>edu</a>. Exceptions to these guidelines will be handled on a case-by-case base. Special project collaborations are examples of situations requiring direct communication between OIT-CIRC and the user community.</p>
<div class="section" id="help-desk-tickets">
<h3>Help Desk Tickets<a class="headerlink" href="#help-desk-tickets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Do your homework</strong> before submitting a help desk ticket. What does the user guide and other documentation say? Search the internet for key phrases in your error logs; that’s probably what the consultants answering your ticket are going to do. What have you changed since the last time your job succeeded?</li>
<li><strong>Have realistic expectations.</strong> Consultants can address system issues and answer questions, but they can’t teach parallel programming in a ticket, and may know nothing about the package you downloaded. They may offer general advice that will help you build, debug, optimize, or modify your code, but you shouldn’t expect them to do these things for you.</li>
<li><strong>Describe your issue as precisely and completely as you can:</strong> what you did, what happened, verbatim error messages, other meaningful output. When appropriate, include the information a consultant would need to find your artifacts and understand your workflow: e.g. the directory containg your build and/or job script; the modules you were using; relevant job numbers; and recent changes in your workflow that could affect or explin the behavior you’re observing.</li>
<li><strong>Be patient.</strong> It may take a business day for a consultant to get back to you, especially if your issue is complex. It might take an exchange or two before you and the consultant are on the same page. If the admins disable your account, it’s not punitive. When the file system is in danger of crashing or a login node hangs, they don’t have tim to notify you before taking action.</li>
